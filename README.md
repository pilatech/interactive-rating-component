## My process
 - Thought of how my markup would look based on desktop layout ( with mobile layout still in mind)
 - Created markup based on semantics ( with visual appearance still in mind but not being the main focus)
 - Wrote CSS for mobile first then fixed where desktop didn't fit well later
 - Wrote JavaScript at last

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Learnt the proper use of some html elements such as i per the HTML specs

### Continued development

Writing further CSS until it becomes second nature

### Useful resources

- [HTML Specs](https://html.spec.whatwg.org) - It is good for confirming whether you are using a certain HTML element the right way or not.
